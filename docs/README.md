# upMVC Docs Structure

This folder now includes a subject-based structure under `docs/subjects/` to make navigation easier. Original documents remain in the root to preserve existing links; each subject includes an index linking to the documents. We can move files later once consumers update links.

## Subjects

- Routing — `subjects/routing/README.md`
- React — `subjects/react/README.md`
- Vue — `subjects/vue/README.md`
- Config — `subjects/config/README.md`
- Bugs & Fixes — `subjects/bugs/README.md`
- Cleanup — `subjects/cleanup/README.md`
- Philosophy — `subjects/philosophy/README.md`
- Architecture — `subjects/architecture/README.md`
- Islands Architecture — `subjects/islands/README.md`
- Integrations — `subjects/integration/README.md`
- Release & Status — `subjects/release-status/README.md`
- Guides — `subjects/guides/README.md`
- State Management — `subjects/state/README.md`
- URL Handling — `subjects/url/README.md`
- Examples — `subjects/examples/README.md`

## Sorting by Date

Within each subject index, entries are listed (pending) by date. For accurate ordering, we can use Git commit dates. If you want, I can fetch and apply Git history to sort each list.
